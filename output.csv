10:26:41, I don't know.
10:26:56, Hmm.
10:26:58, Hmm.
10:26:59, Hmm.
10:27:01," So, what's the next thing?"
10:27:05, No.
10:27:08, Hmm.
10:27:10, Hmm.
10:27:13, Hmm.
10:27:17, Hmm.
10:27:22, Hmm.
10:27:28, I think it's a little uncomfortable.
10:27:31," As expected, my pants are heavy, right?"
10:27:36, Hm-hm.
10:27:37," Yeah, I think that's just how it's supposed to be."
10:27:45, Isn't there something left?
10:27:49, Hm.
10:27:50, Umm...
10:27:51,ering...
10:27:52, It feels the same way at first glance.
10:27:56, What's this's type of pockets?
10:27:57, wrong
10:28:04,你们
10:28:12, us
10:28:20," Ah, that's right."
10:28:24," Ah, that's right."
10:28:27," Ah, that's right."
10:28:29," Ah, well, I think that's a bit..."
10:28:33," Oh, I hope I get a little better if I get a little better."
10:28:37," Ah, that's right."
10:28:42," That's right, that's right."
10:28:46," Ah, I got a little better."
10:28:49, It's a little bit...
10:28:51," Ah, that's right."
10:28:54, I was just looking at it.
10:28:58," Ah, that's right, that's right."
10:29:02," Ah, that's right."
10:29:05, I'm not afraid of it.
10:29:08," Ah, I see."
10:29:11, Hmm.
10:29:21, Hmm.
10:29:23," So, here."
10:29:27, Where did you come from?
10:29:29, Oh.
10:29:31," Oh, this."
10:29:37, I see.
10:29:39, That's right.
10:29:41, I'm curious.
10:29:43, And I'm curious.
10:29:51, What's this?
10:29:53," Oh, this is a piece of paper."
10:29:55, I see.
10:29:57, I'll open this.
10:29:59," Oh, right."
10:30:01, I see.
10:30:03, I'll open it.
10:30:07, Oh.
10:30:09, I'm curious.
10:30:11, I'm curious.
10:30:13, I don't know exactly what it means.
10:30:17," But in this song,"
10:30:19, I'll play the sixth or sixth song.
10:30:23, I was playing it at the top of the line.
10:30:27, I'm not playing it.
10:30:29, I'm not playing it.
10:30:31, I'm not playing it.
10:30:33," Oh, there's something in the middle."
10:30:35, There's something like that.
10:30:37, Yes.
10:30:39, I was playing it at the top of the line.
10:30:41, I was playing it at the top of the line.
10:30:43," Oh, you didn't say that."
10:30:45, I'm not playing it.
10:30:47, It's so interesting.
10:30:49, Yes.
10:30:51, I was playing it at the top of the line.
10:30:55, I don't know what that means.
10:30:59, I'm not playing it.
10:31:01, I'm not playing it.
10:31:05, I'm not playing it.
10:31:11, I at the top of the line.
10:31:13, I am not playing when I'm playing it.
10:31:15, But I wonder if that will be it.
10:31:17, It's impossible.
10:31:19, Yes.
10:31:21, The first start.
10:31:23, But the first start is a release Song's song.
10:31:27," I said,"
10:31:32, I thought he made it so I didn't feel good as he was nuts
10:31:38, But this method doesn't need to be help
10:31:44, It's way better to stretch it
10:31:49, Now I'm going back to reading the very first at 8AM
10:32:01, It's 6-8K.
10:32:03, That's right.
10:32:07, Where is the enemy?
10:32:09, Where is the enemy?
10:32:11, I don't know.
10:32:13, I don't know.
10:32:15, I don't know.
10:32:17, I think it's a good idea.
10:32:19, It's more like this.
10:32:21, I don't know.
10:32:23, I don't know if it's a good idea.
10:32:25, It's a good idea.
10:32:27, It's a good idea.
10:32:29, I don't know.
10:32:31, I don't know.
10:32:33, What is it?
10:32:39," He's pulling the sword, so he's pushing it."
10:32:43, Can you make it easier to push?
10:32:45, I see.
10:32:47, I'll push it.
10:32:49, It's hard.
10:32:51, It's hard.
10:32:53," In that case, I lost the second hand."
10:33:16," In the case of the Ace kick that was little too late to reverse attack, he took the first turn left so far."
10:33:22, I just think of Freeman Seems that the smartphone will play
10:33:35, That's the first time.
10:33:39, I don't know.
10:33:45, I don't know.
10:33:47, I don't know.
10:33:49, I took a short break.
10:33:51, I took a short break.
10:33:53, I was in a hurry.
10:33:57, I see.
10:34:05, I see.
10:34:13, There was a 1980s back wיש.
10:34:24," In 2009, K مثuha photo labant Kowedagura, K Thanko Proвод."
10:34:28," Even after the elementary Almost, I can see a glowing microphone mere days and running."
10:34:35, Should you wait anything 30 seconds to refill it on the other side?
10:34:42, I should be able to fix the second trial with that using aครana-3.
10:34:48, You did.
10:34:51, I think it's a bit difficult to get a 7-1 shot.
10:34:57, I see.
10:34:59," Oh, I see."
10:35:01, I see.
10:35:03, I see.
10:35:05, I see.
10:35:07, I see.
10:35:09, I see.
10:35:11, I see.
10:35:13, I see.
10:35:15, I see.
10:35:17, I see.
10:35:19, I see.
10:35:21, I see.
10:35:23, I see.
10:35:25, I wonder if it was a bit trendy.
10:35:27, Oh.
10:35:29, It's time to be careful.
10:35:33, Thanks for today.
10:35:35, Thank you very much.
